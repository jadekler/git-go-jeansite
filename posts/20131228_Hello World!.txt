This blog was built to learn Go but also to post things that I pick up along the way. I believe strongly that programmers as a whole benefit from a community of giving, not just one of taking. 

Therefore, I hope that you - the reader - finds something here of worth. And if nothing else, go fork my repo for this site (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jadekler/git-go-jeansite">https://github.com/jadekler/git-go-jeansite</a>) and start your own blog!
